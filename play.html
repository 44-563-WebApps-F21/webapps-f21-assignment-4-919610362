    <h5>A Woman of no Importance</h5>

    <h6>ACT III. _The Hall at Hunstanton Chase_.</h6>

    [LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]

<pre>
    <p>
        GERALD.  [_Laughing_.]      I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
        Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know
        how to talk.
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to
        every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you
        will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.
        <br>
        GERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either
        to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!
        <br>
        GERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it
        simply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real
        success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule
        society.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You
        might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at
        once.
        <br>
        GERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are
        pictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really
        means—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,
        don’t listen to her.
        <br>
        GERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the
        philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over
        mind—just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
        <br>
        GERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form
        of tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the
        strong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.
        <br>
        GERALD.  But haven’t women got a refining influence?
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.
        <br>
        GERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?
        <br>
        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.
        <br>
        GERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren’t there?
