    ACT III. _The Hall at Hunstanton Chase_.
    

    [LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a
sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]
</h5>
<p style="white-space: pre">

        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Laughing_.]</p>      <p class="speech">I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
        Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know
        how to talk.</p>        
    
        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to
        every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you
        will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.</p>
    
        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">But it is very difficult to get into society isn’t it?</p>
            
        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either
        to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!</p>
    
        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!</p>
    
        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it
        simply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real
        success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule
        society.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You
        might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once.</p>
    
        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?</p>
    
        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">You should never try to understand them.  Women are
        means—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her,
        don’t listen to her.</p>
    
        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?</p>

        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">The history of women is the history of the worst form
            of tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the
            strong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.</p>

        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">But haven’t women got a refining influence?</p>

        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">Nothing refines but the intellect.</p>

        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren’t there?</p>

        <h5 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.</p>
    
        <h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">But there are good women in society, aren’t there?</p>
