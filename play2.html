        <h5 class="name gerald nameHover">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="stage_directions hover">[_Laughing_.]</p>      <p class="speech">I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
        Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know
        how to talk.</p>        
    
        <h5 class="name lordillingworth nameHover">LORD ILLINGWORTH.</h5>  <p class="speech">Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to
        every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you
        will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.</p>

        to feed people, amuse people, or shock people—that is all!</p>
    
        <h5 class="name gerald nameHover">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="speech">I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!</p>
